# Visual Design
Cover theme: 速度差套利
Type: minimal
Style: notion
Text level: title-only
Mood: subtle
Aspect ratio: 16:9
Language: zh

# Text Elements
Title: 币安驱动套利

# Mood Application
Use low contrast, muted colors, light visual weight, calm aesthetic. Professional and technical feel without being heavy or aggressive.

# Composition
Type composition (minimal):
- Single focal element representing the core concept
- Generous whitespace (60%+ of the canvas)
- Essential shapes only, no decorative clutter
- Clean, zen-like simplicity

Visual composition:
- Main visual: Two parallel horizontal flows/streams at different speeds
  - Top flow (fast): Represents Binance - thicker line, faster implied motion, leading position
  - Bottom flow (slow): Represents Polymarket - thinner line, slower motion, lagging position
  - Between them: A simple vertical dashed line or subtle arrows showing arbitrage opportunity in the gap
- Layout: Horizontally centered, using the full width advantage of 16:9 aspect ratio. Elements positioned in the middle third of the canvas, massive whitespace above and below
- Decorative: Minimal - only essential labels like "币安" and "Polymarket" in small, clean sans-serif font. Possibly a small dollar/price icon ($) to hint at financial context

Color scheme (notion style + subtle mood):
- Primary: Black (#1A1A1A) for main outlines and text
- Background: Pure White (#FFFFFF) for maximum cleanliness
- Accent: Pastel Blue (#A8D4F0) for the fast flow (Binance), very muted
- Secondary: Light Gray (#E8E8E8) for the slow flow (Polymarket)
- All colors desaturated and low-contrast to match subtle mood

Type notes (minimal):
- Extreme simplicity, single concept focus
- Whitespace as a design element, not empty space
- Hand-drawn wobble effect on lines (notion style) to add human warmth without complexity
- No gradients, no shadows, no textures

Style notes (notion):
- Clean, minimalist hand-drawn line art with slight wobble
- Simple doodle-style with intentional imperfection
- Single-weight line work throughout
- Pastel accents used sparingly, only on the fast flow to differentiate
- Maximum whitespace with single concept focus
- Notion-like aesthetic: thoughtful, organized, calm

# Specific Visual Elements

1. **Title Text**: "币安驱动套利" positioned at bottom or top, using clean sans-serif font (like Inter or similar), black color, medium weight

2. **Flow Visualization**:
   - Upper flow (Binance): Slightly thicker hand-drawn line with pastel blue fill, arrow pointing right, labeled "币安" on the left
   - Lower flow (Polymarket): Thinner hand-drawn line with light gray fill, arrow pointing right but visually "behind" the upper flow, labeled "Polymarket" on the left
   - Gap indicator: Subtle vertical dashed line or small arrows in the space between the two flows, representing the arbitrage window

3. **Composition Balance**:
   - Flows occupy only central 30-40% of canvas height
   - Top and bottom margins: 30%+ each
   - Left and right margins: 10-15% each
   - Title text: 5-8% of canvas height, positioned cleanly without touching flows

4. **Hand-drawn Quality** (notion style):
   - Lines should have slight organic wobble, not perfectly straight
   - Arrows should be simple, hand-drawn style
   - Labels in clean but slightly irregular hand-lettering (or clean sans-serif if hand-lettering is too complex)

# Avoid
- Complex illustrations with multiple elements
- Bright or saturated colors (conflicts with subtle mood)
- Dense information or multiple data points
- Any 3D effects, gradients, or shadows
- Literal representations of trading interfaces or charts
- Overlapping or crowded elements
